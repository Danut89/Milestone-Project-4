> 💡 Many of these tools are also documented throughout the development process in commit messages, planning docs, and this README.

---

## 📐 Code Quality

Maintaining clean, consistent, and maintainable code was a priority throughout the development of FitZone Pro. The project adheres to best practices and standards in both frontend and backend development.

---

### 🧱 Project Structure

- Django’s default project layout was followed and extended with **modular apps**:
  - `nutrition`: recipes, meal plans, and wishlist
  - `shop`: product catalog and categories
  - `cart` / `orders`: e-commerce flow
  - `profiles`: user profile and settings
- Static files (CSS, JS, images) and templates are **organized by app** for scalability and clarity.
- Reusable components (cards, buttons, toasts) are styled via a central CSS system.

---

### 🔤 Naming Conventions & Consistency

- All file and folder names are lowercase and use hyphens or underscores for clarity.
- Models, views, forms, and functions use **descriptive and semantically meaningful names**.
- URL paths and template names are consistent and reflect the feature they belong to.
- HTML classes follow **BEM-style** naming when needed for clarity (e.g. `meal-card__header`).

---

### 📘 Readable & Documented Code

- Inline comments are added for complex logic or less obvious code blocks.
- Each major template, view, and model is preceded by a docstring or section comment.
- Python code conforms to **PEP8** style guide using Flake8 linter.
- HTML and CSS were validated using **W3C validators** with no critical issues remaining.

---

### 🛡️ Defensive Coding & Error Handling

- Input validation is handled at both form and model level using Django’s built-in validators.
- Forms return user-friendly error messages when validation fails.
- Views use `get_object_or_404()` and `try/except` blocks to prevent crashes and handle edge cases.
- Stripe checkout includes error catching and fallback user feedback.

---

### ⚖️ Separation of Concerns

- Views contain business logic only; template logic is kept clean and minimal.
- Templates are built using **Django template inheritance** (`base.html` layout).
- All styles are stored in `index.css`, `nutrition.css`, and `shop.css`, reducing inline clutter.
- JavaScript used only where necessary, in dedicated JS files (e.g. toasts, quantity update).


> 🧠 This clean, readable, and maintainable codebase supports long-term scalability and follows industry standards. Quality is further supported by a consistent Git commit history documenting feature additions, fixes, and testing.

---
## Database

### Application Data Overview

FitZone Pro is a wellness-focused full-stack web application designed around a relational PostgreSQL database. Its structured data supports core functionality such as:

- **Users**: Authentication, profile management, and dashboard preferences.
- **Recipes**: Meal components with ingredients, cooking steps, and metadata.
- **Meal Plans**: Multi-day structures combining recipes for personalized goals.
- **Wishlist**: Save recipes and plans to personal favorites.
- **Products & Categories**: Nutrition and fitness-related goods available for purchase.
- **Orders & Cart Items**: E-commerce features powered by Stripe integration.

All data is normalized and managed through Django ORM. Models are organized into distinct apps reflecting their domain logic (e.g. `nutrition`, `orders`, `profiles`).

---

### Model Relationships

The FitZone Pro backend is built on a normalized PostgreSQL database using Django ORM. The app is split into modular Django apps, each with its own set of models.

The data schema is structured around the following core relationships:

- **User & UserProfile**: A one-to-one link between Django's default `User` model and the extended `UserProfile` model, which stores delivery details and user preferences.
  
- **Meal Plans, Days & Recipes**: 
  - Each `MealPlan` consists of multiple `MealPlanDay` entries (One-to-Many).
  - Each `MealPlanDay` can include multiple `Recipe` objects via a join table `meal_plan_day_recipes` (Many-to-Many).
  
- **Wishlist**:
  - A user can save both `Recipe` and `MealPlan` objects to their `Wishlist`.
  - Each wishlist entry references a `User` and either a `Recipe` or a `MealPlan`.

- **Product & Category**: 
  - Each `Product` belongs to a `Category` (One-to-Many).
  - Products are displayed in the shop and used in both the cart and orders.

- **Cart System**: 
  - A `CartItem` is created when a user adds a product to their cart.
  - Each cart item references a `User` and a `Product`.

- **Orders & OrderItems**:
  - When a user checks out, an `Order` is created.
  - The `Order` contains multiple `OrderItem` objects, each of which references a `Product` and quantity.

These relationships allow for a scalable, real-world structure that supports complex user workflows, including saving meal plans, checking out orders, and customizing the user experience.

---

### Normalization and Integrity

- The schema is **fully normalized** to reduce redundancy and improve scalability.
- All **foreign key** relationships enforce **referential integrity**.
- Where relevant, **cascade delete** and `related_name` attributes are used for clarity.
- Indexed fields such as `user_id`, `date_created`, and `meal_plan_id` optimize filtering and performance.

A detailed breakdown of all test cases, tools, methods, and results is available in a separate file:

📄 [**View Full Testing Documentation → `Testing.md`**](Testing.md)

---

## 🔐 Security

Security best practices were followed throughout the development and deployment of FitZone Pro to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure payment processing.

---

###  User Authentication & Access Control

- Django’s built-in authentication system was used for login, registration, logout, and password management.
- Sensitive user data is only accessible to the authenticated user via session control.
- Profile access, dashboard, and checkout pages are restricted to logged-in users using `@login_required`.
- Admin-only features (like editing products) are protected using `@user_passes_test` and staff checks.
- Superusers have access to Django Admin; regular users do not.

---

###  Input Validation & Form Protection

- All forms include CSRF tokens (Django adds them automatically).
- Django form and model validation is used to prevent invalid data from entering the database.
- Forms return meaningful error messages for users and reject unexpected data types.
- Checkout form and profile update forms include both frontend and backend validation.

---

###  Stripe Payment Security

- Stripe test keys were used during development.
- Card data is **never stored** on the server; it is handled entirely by Stripe's secure JavaScript SDK.
- Only authenticated users can initiate a checkout.
- Payment success and failure are handled via query strings and validated session data.

---

###  Sensitive Data & Environment Variables

- All sensitive keys (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLIC/SECRET_KEYS`, `DATABASE_URL`) are stored in environment variables.
- The `.env` file is **excluded** from version control using `.gitignore`.
- On deployment platforms (e.g., Render), secrets are configured in the dashboard UI.

---

###  General Deployment Practices

- `DEBUG = False` in production settings
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` explicitly set
- Static files are served using **WhiteNoise** (production-ready)
- Admin URL kept default unless otherwise protected (optional to change to a non-standard URL)
- All outgoing dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`


> 🔐 FitZone Pro follows Django’s security model and industry standards for authentication, validation, and secret management.

---
